# App

The files under this directory get copied into CHIP project's [examples/lighting-app/linux](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/lighting-app/linux) to inject GPIO control functionality into the upstream example. 
The reason for this approach is to maintain the simplicity of this example and rely on the existing upstream build configurations.
